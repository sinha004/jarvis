## Development
- For local development with live reload: `npm run dev` (requires live-server)
- For production build: `npm run build`

## Architecture
The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in a simplified manner.  The HTML acts as the View, displaying the calculator interface. The JavaScript (script.js and component files) acts as both the Controller and Model. It handles user input (button clicks, keyboard input), performs calculations, updates the display, and manages the state of the calculator (current number, operator, result).  Event listeners are attached to the buttons to trigger the appropriate JavaScript functions.  The Display component handles the actual rendering of the result and current expression, improving modularity. Basic memory functions are handled within the main `script.js` file to keep things simple, but could be broken out into a 'Memory' component for more complex memory management.

## Dependencies
